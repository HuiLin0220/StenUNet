# Introduction
This algorithm is for the stenosis detection task in [ARCADE Challenge](https://arcade.grand-challenge.org/), which was held at MICCAI 2023. We are ranked **3rd**!

Our publication:  StenUNet: Automatic Stenosis Detection from X-ray Coronary Angiography [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14961)

Please refer to [MICCAI-ARCADE](https://github.com/NMHeartAI/MICCAI_ARCADE.git) for the segmentation detection task.


## Installation
